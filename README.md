<strong>Stage 1:   Background and Organizational Analysis</strong>




Before you begin work on this assignment, be sure you have read the Case Study which is located in Content under Course Resources.  Refer to the Business Analysis and System Recommendations (BA&amp;SR) Table of Contents below to see where you are in the process of developing this report.

<strong>Overview</strong>




As a business analyst in the Chief Information Officer’s (CIO’s) department of Chesapeake IT Consulting (CIC), you have been assigned to conduct an analysis, develop a set of system requirements and propose an IT solution to improve the hiring process for CIC.   This work will be completed in four stages, and each of these four stages will focus on one section of an overall <strong>Business Analysis and System Recommendation</strong> (BA&amp;SR) report to be delivered to the CIO.




The graphic below outlines the Table of Contents for this report:

<strong>Section I: Background and Organizational Analysis</strong> (Stage 1) <strong>WEEK 2 Submission</strong>– The first step is to look at the organization and explain how an IT system could benefit CIC by improving its hiring system.

<strong>Section II: Strategic Use of Technology</strong> (Stage 2) <strong>WEEK 4 Submission</strong>– Next you will explain, in general, how CIC can use IT for strategic purposes.

<strong>Section III: Strategic and Operational Outcomes</strong> (Stage 3) <strong>WEEK 4 Submission</strong>– Then you will analyze CIC’s strategy and processes to determine how technology solutions can be used to support the organizational processes and enable CIC’s strategic and operational outcomes, and develop a set of requirements for the new hiring system.

<strong>Section IV: System Recommendation</strong> (Stage 4)<strong>WEEK  8 Submission</strong> – Finally, you will identify an enterprise hiring system for CIC, and explain how it meets the requirements, and what needs to be done to implement the system within CIC.




The sections of the BA&amp;SR will be developed and submitted as four staged assignments.  In stages 2, 3 and 4, you will also incorporate any feedback received when the previous stage is graded to improve the effectiveness of your overall report and then add the new section to your report.   At the end of the course, you will submit a complete BA&amp;SR document that includes all the sections and changes that resulted from previous feedback.

<strong>Assignment – BA&amp;SR Section I – Background and Organizational Analysis (Stage 1)</strong>




Section I of the BA&amp;SR document contains an organizational analysis and identifies ways in which information systems can help the organization in the case study (CIC) to meet its strategic goals and meet the information needs of various levels of management.  This analysis lays the ground work for the next section of the BA&amp;SR which will explain how technology can be used to support specific strategic activities of the organization.




Using the case study, assignment instructions, Course Content readings, and external resources, develop your <em>Section I: Background and Organizational Analysis</em>.  Recommended lengths for each section are provided and be sure to include all pertinent information.  A key to successful business writing is quality and conciseness rather than quantity.




To start, review the Business Perspectives Module (week 1 content), particularly the sections that describe the example of Booz Allen Hamilton, a services company with a business model similar to that of CIC in the case study.  The case study tells you that the executives and employees at CIC have identified a need for an effective and efficient hiring system.  As you review the case study, use the outline below to help you take notes to assist in your analysis; in particular, list the needs of the individuals expressed in the “interviews.”




<ol>

 <li><strong>Background and Organizational Analysis</strong></li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>

<ol>

 <li><strong>Introduction – </strong>briefly describe (at a high level) the organization in the Case Study; provide a context for the rest of the document. (one paragraph)</li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>

<ol>

 <li><strong>Organizational Strategy </strong>– Using the Business Strategy statement and information from the Case Study, explain how a new hiring system would support that strategy<strong>. </strong>(Two to three strong sentences that explain how the system would support the strategy and justify your position with specifics from the Case Study).</li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>

<ol>

 <li><strong>Components of an Information System – </strong>Explain each of the following in relationship to an information system to support the hiring process at CIC:</li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>

<ol>

 <li><strong>People and Technology</strong> – Identify the interest or objectives for the new hiring system for <strong>each</strong> stakeholder listed below based on his or her organizational role. Include how the technology will improve how the job is done; that is, identify what each of the stakeholders needs the <strong>system </strong>to do.  (Introductory sentence or two, followed by 1-2 sentences for each role)

<strong>Formatting Your Assignment</strong>




For academic writing, the writer is expected to write in the third person. In third person, the writer avoids the pronouns I, we, my, and ours. The third person is used to make the writing more objective by taking the individual, the “self,” out of the writing. This method is very helpful for academic writing, a form in which facts, not opinion, drive the tone of the text. Writing in the third person allows the writer to come across as unbiased and thus more informed.




<ul>

 <li>Write a short concise paper: Use the recommendations provided in each area for length of response.  Content areas should be double spaced; table entries should be single-spaced. It’s important to value quality over quantity.  Assignment should not exceed 4 pages.</li>
